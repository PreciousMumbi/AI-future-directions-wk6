Potential Bias:
- Most AI models trained on datasets like TCGA are biased toward white, high-income patients.
- Underrepresentation of African, Asian, and Latinx populations.

Consequences:
- Treatment recommendations risk being less effective for minorities.
- Mistrust in AI-powered healthcare tools.
- Exacerbation of healthcare inequalities.

Fairness Strategies:
- Balance datasets by seeking global collaborations.
- Use subgroup-specific accuracy and bias audits.
- Apply AI bias mitigation techniques (re-weighting, oversampling minorities).
- Demand model explainability before clinical use.

Ethical AI in medicine must prioritize equity and patient safety equally.
