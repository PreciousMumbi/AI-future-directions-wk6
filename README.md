ðŸ“¦ AI Future Directions Project
This project explores emerging AI applications through three tasks:

ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Edge AI Prototype
Tool: TensorFlow + TensorFlow Lite

Model: Lightweight image classifier using CIFAR-10 as a proxy for recyclable items

Result: Converted to .tflite model for deployment on Edge devices (e.g. Raspberry Pi)

ðŸ“Œ Task 2: AI-Driven IoT Concept
Use Case: Smart agriculture system predicting crop yields

Components: Soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light sensors

Model: TensorFlow regression model

Deliverable: Data flow diagram illustrating the system pipeline

ðŸ“Œ Task 3: Ethics in Personalized Medicine
Focus: AI treatment recommendation bias risks

Strategy: Promote diverse, representative training data and fairness metrics
